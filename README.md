## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Storage**: localStorage for client-side persistence
- **Development**: Live Server for local development
- **Deployment**: Static hosting (Netlify/Vercel/GitHub Pages)

## Quick Start

### 🚀 Local Development & Testing

#### Method 1: Development Script (Recommended)
```bash
cd todo-list-app
./scripts/dev.sh
```
- ✅ Automatically opens browser at http://localhost:3000
- ✅ Live reload on file changes
- ✅ Full functionality with proper HTTP server

#### Method 2: Manual Setup
```bash
# Clone and navigate to project
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd todo-list-app

# Option A: Using npx (Node.js required)
npx live-server --port=3000

# Option B: Using Python
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then open http://localhost:8000

# Option C: Direct file opening (limited functionality)
open index.html  # macOS
# or double-click index.html in file explorer
```

#### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (for live-server) - recommended approach
- **Python 3** (alternative) - built into most systems
- **Modern browser** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge

### 🧪 Testing Checklist

Once running locally, test these features:

**Core Functionality:**
- ✅ Add tasks (Enter key or Add button)
- ✅ Mark tasks complete/incomplete (checkbox)
- ✅ Edit tasks (double-click to edit)
- ✅ Delete tasks (× button)
- ✅ Task counter updates in real-time

**Advanced Features:**
- ✅ Filter tasks: All / Active / Completed
- ✅ Clear completed tasks bulk action
- ✅ Data persistence (refresh page to verify)
- ✅ Responsive design (resize browser window)
- ✅ Keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape keys)

**Performance:**
- ✅ App loads in under 2 seconds
- ✅ Task operations respond instantly
- ✅ Smooth animations and transitions

### 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Server won't start:**
```bash
# Install live-server globally if needed
npm install -g live-server
```

**Port already in use:**
```bash
# Use different port
npx live-server --port=3001
```

**Limited functionality with file:// protocol:**
- Always use HTTP server (Methods 1 or 2A/2B above)
- Direct file opening may have localStorage restrictions

**Browser doesn't auto-open:**
- Manually navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or your chosen port)
