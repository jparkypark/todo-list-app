- **Delete Tasks**: One-click deletion with slide-out animation
- **Mark Complete**: Visual checkbox with strikethrough styling
- **Persistent Storage**: localStorage for session persistence

### Enhanced Features  
- **Task Filtering**: All/Active/Completed views
- **Task Counter**: Real-time count of remaining items
- **Clear Completed**: Bulk action to remove finished tasks
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on mobile and desktop
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Animations**: Smooth slide-in/out transitions

### Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
- **Architecture**: Clean class-based structure with proper separation of concerns
- **Storage**: Client-side localStorage with error handling
- **Styling**: CSS custom properties, responsive grid, modern animations
- **Performance**: Fast load times, smooth 60fps animations
